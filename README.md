# Heart Attack Prediction Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset aimed at predicting heart attack risks, featuring **8,763 records** and **26 attributes** related to cardiovascular health. It serves as a valuable resource for developing predictive models and exploring the impact of lifestyle choices on heart health outcomes.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop and validate predictive models for heart attack risk using the provided dataset. By analyzing the correlations between various health metrics, lifestyle factors, and demographic information, we aim to identify key risk factors and improve early detection methods for heart disease.

## Dataset Details

- **Total Records:** 8,763
- **Total Attributes:** 26
- **Key Features:**
  - **Demographics:**
    - **Age:** Age of the individual (in years).
    - **Sex:** Gender of the individual (1 = male, 0 = female).
    - **Country:** The country of residence, providing a geographical context.
  - **Health Metrics:**
    - **Cholesterol Levels:** Measured in mg/dL, indicating the total cholesterol level.
    - **Blood Pressure:** Systolic and diastolic measurements (in mmHg).
    - **Heart Rate:** Beats per minute, indicating the individual's heart rate.
  - **Lifestyle Factors:**
    - **Smoking Status:** Whether the individual is a smoker (1 = yes, 0 = no).
    - **Diet:** Categorized as Healthy, Average, or Unhealthy, based on dietary choices.
    - **Exercise Habits:** Frequency of physical activity (e.g., none, moderate, vigorous).
    - **Body Mass Index (BMI):** A calculated value based on height and weight.
  - **Medical History:**
    - **Diabetes:** Indicates if the individual has diabetes (1 = yes, 0 = no).
    - **Family History of Heart Disease:** Indicates if there is a family history of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).
    - **Previous Health Issues:** Any prior medical conditions related to cardiovascular health.

- **Data Quality:**
  - **Missing Values:** The dataset is free from missing values, ensuring reliability in analysis.
  - **Outliers:** Initial exploration may reveal outliers in health metrics; further analysis is recommended.
